Program Description:
This program simulates and visualizes the population growth of several cities in Florida over 20 years. It begins by creating a database that contains the initial population data for 10 cities in Florida for the year 2023. Then, it simulates population growth for each city at a 2% growth rate per year for the next 20 years. The user can choose a city to view its population growth visually in a graph generated by matplotlib.
________________


Logical Steps:
1. Create a new SQLite database population_SM.db to store the population data.
2. Create a table called population with columns for city, year, and population.
3. Insert initial population data for 10 cities in Florida for the year 2023 into the population table.
4. Define a function to simulate the population growth at a 2% annual growth rate for the next 20 years, inserting each year’s population for every city into the database.
5. Define a function to allow the user to choose a city and view the population growth graph for that city using matplotlib.
6. Allow the user to repeatedly choose different cities to view their population growth, or exit the program.

Variables:
1. conn: A connection object used to interact with the SQLite database.
2. cursor: A cursor object used to execute SQL commands within the database.
3. cities_data: A list of tuples representing the initial population data for each city in Florida for the year 2023.
4. city_name: A string representing the name of the city chosen by the user.
5. years: A list of years (2023–2043) representing the years for which population data is available.
6. populations: A list of population values for a particular city across the years.
7. city_names: A list of unique city names retrieved from the database to present to the user.

2. Function Name: insert_initial_data
Description: Inserts the initial population data for 10 cities in Florida for the year 2023 into the database.
Parameters: None
Returns: None
3. Function Name: simulate_population_growth
Description: Simulates population growth for the next 20 years at a 2% annual growth rate for each city and inserts this data into the database.
Parameters: None
