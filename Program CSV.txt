Program Description:
This program allows users to input and store student grades in a CSV file. The user is prompted to enter the number of students, followed by their first and last names, and grades for three exams. Once the data is collected, it is written to a file named grades.csv. The program also reads the data from the CSV file and displays it in a formatted manner.

4. Loop for the number of students, collecting each student's first name, last name, and exam grades.
5. Write each student's data as a new row in the CSV file.
6. Close the file and confirm data has been written.
7. Open the CSV file for reading and create a reader object.
8. Read the header and display it.
9. Loop through the CSV file and print each student's data in a formatted manner.
