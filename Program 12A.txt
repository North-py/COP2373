Program Description:
This program calculates the grades statistics of students for three exams. It stores the student names and grades in a CSV file, then reads that data into a NumPy array. The program computes various statistics for each exam, such as mean, median, standard deviation, and range. Additionally, it calculates pass/fail statistics for each exam based on a passing grade of 60.

Logical Steps:
1. Store the student grades in a CSV file: Prepopulate data for 10 students and their grades for 3 exams in grades.csv.
2. Read the data from the CSV file: Extract and store the grades of each student in a NumPy array for analysis.
3. Calculate individual statistics for each exam: Compute the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for each exam.
4. Calculate overall statistics for all exams: Combine all exam data and compute statistics for all grades collectively.
5. Calculate pass/fail statistics: Determine how many students passed or failed each exam based on a passing grade of 60 or above.
6. Display results: Print out all the calculated statistics and pass/fail counts for each exam.

Variables:
1. students: A predefined list of 10 students, with their grades for 3 exams.
2. grades: A 2D NumPy array containing the grades for each student across all exams.
3. passing_grades: A boolean NumPy array representing whether a student passed each exam.
4. total_passed: The total number of passing grades across all exams.
