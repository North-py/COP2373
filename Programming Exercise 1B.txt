Program Description: 
The program simulates the magic 8 ball toy, by loading random yes or no answers off a .txt file named 8ball_responeses. So a user would ask a basic yes or no question and receive an answer from the file and can continue until done using the program.


Logical Steps:  
1. Load Responses
2. Start Loop
3. Ask Question
4. Exit Condition
5. Select Response
6. Display Response
7. Repeat or Exit
Variables:  
1. Ball_responses: Parameter for the get_responses_from_file function, representing the file path.
2. File: File object used in get_responses_from_file to read from the file.
3. Responses: List of responses read from the file.
4. Question: User input for asking a yes/no question.
5. Response: Randomly selected response from the responses list.
Functions:
* Function Name: get_responses_from_file(ball_responses)
   Description: This function takes a file path as an argument, reads the file, and returns a list of responses.
   Parameters: Represents the file path (as a string) from which the function reads the responses.
   Returns: The list of responses that the program randomly chooses from
* Function Name: magic_8_ball()
Description: This function runs the main Magic 8-Ball simulation. It loads responses from a file, continuously prompts the user for input, and prints a random response until the user decides to quit.
Parameters: Does not have parameters, it uses the file path to run
Returns: Prompts the user to ask a yes/no questions or to quit (not really a return just using the users response)
